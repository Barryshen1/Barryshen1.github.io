Hi! I'm a first-year master's student at the University of Washington in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Prior to UW, I received my BEng from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and Liverpool University in 2024, advised by Prof. Jieming Ma.

I'm broadly interested in:
* (Multimodal) Foundation Models
* LLM Agents
* AI4Research

I'm currently working as a remote intern at the Yale NLP Lab. I'm also working as a Research Intern on a collaborative project between the University of Washington and Lenovo Research.

I'm seeking research intern positions in large language models and PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.
