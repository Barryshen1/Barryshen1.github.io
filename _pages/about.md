Hi! I'm a first-year master's student at the University of Washington in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Prior to UW, I received my BEng from Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and Liverpool University in 2024, advised by Prof. Jieming Ma.

I'm broadly interested in:
* Computer Vision (CV)
* Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
* Large Language Models (LLMs)

I'm currently working as a remote intern at the Yale NLP Lab. I'm also a researcher on a UW-Lenovo Research collaboration focused on "Efficient Inference of Large Language Models on Single GPU."

I'm seeking research intern positions in large language models and PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.
