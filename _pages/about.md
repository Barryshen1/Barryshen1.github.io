Hi! I'm a 2nd-year master's student at the [University of Washington](https://www.ece.uw.edu/) in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Prior to UW, I received my BEng from [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-advanced-technology) and [Liverpool University](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/engineering/) in 2024, advised by Prof. [Jieming Ma](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/JiemingMa).

I'm currently working as a remote intern at the [Yale NLP Lab](https://nlp.cs.yale.edu/). Previously, I worked as a Research Intern on a collaborative project between the University of Washington and [Lenovo Research](https://research.lenovo.com/webapp/view_English/index.html), advised by Prof. [Radha Poovendran](https://people.ece.uw.edu/radha/) and Dr. [Yan Li](http://www.linkedin.com/in/liyancas).

I'm seeking research intern positions in large language models and PhD opportunities for Fall 2026.
